This repository contains the full set of scripts and data workflows developed for my research paper titled **"Economic Disparities in Ride-Sharing Pricing: Evidence from a Congestion Tax Reform in Chicago"**, completed for the ECO 395M: *Causal Inference* course at the Department of Economics, University of Texas at Austin (Spring 2025).

The paper explores whether ride-sharing platforms engage in price discrimination based on community-level socioeconomic indicators, using the 2020 Chicago congestion tax as a quasi-natural experiment. To identify causal effects, I implemented a Difference-in-Regression-Discontinuity-in-Time (Diff-in-RDiT) framework and conducted heterogeneity analysis based on income-based spatial clustering. The findings raise important implications about algorithmic bias and fairness in platform pricing.

All scripts have been made publicly available for transparency, reproducibility, and potential use in related research. If you find this repository helpful, I would appreciate an acknowledgment or citation in your related work.

For any inquiries, collaboration ideas, or research-related opportunities, feel free to reach out. I am currently seeking research-oriented positions and would be grateful for any relevant connections.
